            <h3 id="Trinity College">The Trinity College</h3>
            <p>The history of the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_(Dubl%C3%ADn)">Trinity College</a> is the one that revolves around   <strong> George Salmon</strong>, rector of this university from 1888 to 1904, and women. 
                Salmon, who dedicated part of his life to theology, refused to allow women to study at this university, going so far as to say that if they did, it would be over his dead body. 
                The curious thing is that the day Salmon died was the same day on which the first woman enrolled at Trinity College. For this reason, <u>every time a woman graduates from one of her degrees, she rubs her notes and books over the statue dedicated to this former rector.</u>

                <p>Another story, perhaps less credible but no less entertaining, is that of the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubl%C3%ADn_georgiano">Georgian Quarter</a> which tells of a man returning home from a party to find his wife in bed with another man. 
                    Blinded by rage, the outraged <strong>husband murdered his wife and her lover</strong>. 
                    The next day, when the effects of the alcohol had worn off, <strong>  he discovered that he had been in the wrong house and that the couple he killed were actually his neighbors</strong>. 
                    After this incident, the women of the neighborhood decided to <u> paint the doors of their houses in different colors so that their husbands would not be confused when they returned home at night</u>.</p>

            <h3 id="Bridge">Ha’Penny Bridge</h3>
            <p>The name of the <a href="https://www.esculturaurbanaaragon.com.es/irlanda5.htm">Ha’Penny Bridge</a> built in 1816, is attributed to the price that the <strong>inhabitants of the city had to pay to cross it</strong> . 
                At that time, the poor population lived on one side of the river, but had to cross to the other side every time they had to do any administrative work. 
                Half a penny was an extremely high expense for them, so they had to develop their imagination to save it. Thus, the rule said that <strong>each pair of legs crossing the bridge had to pay the toll, so it was common to see parents carrying their children or even their wives to save the halfpenny for each of them</strong>.
                But what really marked the differences between the two sides of the river was the use that the rich of the time gave to this bridge. 
                While some could not afford the halfpenny, they paid it to simply watch the sunset from the center of the Ha'Penny Bridge.</p>
